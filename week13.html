			  <b><li>Summarize your experience of the class.</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify"><br />When I signed up for this class last semester, I did so because I 
				wanted to take Computer Graphics, and in order to take that class I needed to know C++. Coming into the class, I didn't really know anything about it 
				other than the fact that it would give the the C++ knowledge I needed. Now that I'm done with the class, I can definitively say that I not only feel 
				comfortable using C++, but that I also gained a lot of insight into object-oriented design, much more so than I did with the Java courses I took freshmen 
				year. Dr. Downing has been a great professor who is clearly very knowledgeable about the material he teaches, and did a great job explaining the concepts 
				he was teaching during lecture. 
				</p>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify"><br />The projects for the class were challenging but not overwhelmingly 
				difficult or absurdly time consuming and were more focused in scope than the projects from Operating Systems, which I appreciated. I did feel however that 
				I never quite got a good handle on a lot of the tools we were required to use for them, such as clang-check, gcov, and valgrind. I realize that those tools 
				can be useful, but I don't feel like I understand them enough to be comfortable using them on personal projects going forward. I also struggled each project 
				when it came to making good unit tests, especially when it came to the more complicated projects. In general though, I think I learned a great deal from 
				completing these projects. 
				</p>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify"><br />Overall, I would say that this is a great class to take if you're 
				looking to learn C++ or gain object-oriented design knowledge, especially if your past two semesters have involved coding in C, as was the case with me. 
				I also think that this class has been a major boost for my resume. I've had multiple interviews where companies have brought up my OOP experience and have 
				asked me related questions. Being able to answer those questions and have C++ projects to back it up has been very useful. I definitely think that this class 
				is much more beneficial than trying to learn C++ on your own, because it can get tricky in some respects. To summarize, I would say that OOP has been the most 
				beneficial computer science course I've taken to date.
