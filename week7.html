			  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">This past week was pretty crazy! I had two tests, one in Chemistry 
				and one in this class! I felt pretty decent about both of them. For this class I wasn't really sure what to expect but I'm happy with 
				how I did. I definitely think I'll be in a position where I can be more successful on the next one though. Aside from my tests, I also 
				went to the Red River Showdown game in Dallas and spent some time at the Texas State Fair.
				</p>
			  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">In terms of my school work, my Algorithms class is currently a major 
				obstacle in my way. I haven't been doing as well in that class as I had hoped, so I'm going need to turn things around a bit during 
				the remainder of the semester if I don't want it making a big negative impact on my GPA. </p> 
			  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">Next week I'm going to start up on project 3 for this class and 
				continue to apply for internships as I find them. I'll also be celebrating my 21st birthday this week!</p> 
				<b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">Now that we've had our first test of the semester for this class, 
				I feel like I am right where I should be. I did about average on the test and didn't feel like it was too difficult. It was more so 
				a case of either knowing the answer or not, at least on the multiple choice portion. I've also been doing well on the projects so far,
				so if the trend continues, I think I'll be able to do well for the remainder of this class.</p>  
			  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My pick-of-the-week is something that I recently discovered and have been 
				trying to learn, Boostrap. Back when I was first learning HTML and CSS, I was always annoyed how I couldn't get my web pages to look good on 
				both the computer and mobile. Well that's where Boostrap comes in! It implements "responsive design" and makes building websites that look 
				good on any device much more manageable. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Check it out!</a>
