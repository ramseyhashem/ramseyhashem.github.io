<h2>Week 5</h2>

  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">This past week I spent most of my time doing the Voting project
	since I ended up getting a late start on it. Unfortunately, I got caught up on an annoying 
	bug that took me longer than I'd like to admit to resolve. However, I managed to get the 
	project done with an hour to spare. I'm definitely going to be starting early on the next 
	project.</p>
  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Right now, the biggest obstacle in my way has to do with my 
	pursuit of an internship. Unfortunately I missed the career fair this semester so I wasn't 
	able to take advantage of that opportunity, and I feel like my resume and portfolio are 
	in need of some serious updating.</p> 
  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Next week I'm going to be spending a lot of time studying for 
	for my first algorithms test, which I'm anticipating will be pretty difficult. I'm also 
	going to be sprucing up my resume a bit more and applying to more internships.</p> 
	<b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">One thing I've noticed in this class that separates it from 
	the other CS classes I've taken thus far is the amount of independence we're given on 
	the projects. I don't think I've ever had a project like the Voting assignment where we 
	literally had no starter code and could essentially do whatever we wanted. It definitely 
	makes the projects a little tougher starting out, but ultimately I've found it pretty 
	rewarding by the time I turn it in.</p>  
  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My pick-of-the-week is the entire Computerphile youtube channel.
	They regularly make really interesting videos that have to do with all aspects of computing 
	and it's a great way to learn things that one would otherwise not have known or be interested 
	in.
