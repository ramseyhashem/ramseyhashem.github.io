			<ol style="margin: 2%; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; margin-left: 4%;">
			  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">This past week I spent a majority of my time finishing up 
				the Allocator project. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get it done in time, so I have to take a late penalty, but I still 
				completed it nonetheless. I also studied for and took my third chemistry test of the semester, which I got a 100 on! 
				</p>
			  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">The main thing in my way right now is time management, as 
				made apparent by my failure to turn project 3 in on time. While I initially intended on starting project 3 early, I ended up 
				being busier than I anticipated, which contributed to my late submission. To address that, I have to make sure that I am 
				organized and on the ball when it comes to my responsibilities.
				</p> 
			  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">Next week I am determined to get started on project 4 for this 
				class early. I don't want another repeat of what happened with this past project. I'm also going to be finishing up my 3D environment 
				modeling project. And who knows, maybe I'll also do some trick-or-treating!
				</p> 
				<b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My experience of the class is the same. Though project 3 was a bit of 
				a set back for me, I am still confident in my ability to learn and use the material we've been covering in class. I'm pretty satisfied 
				with the difficulty and time commitment required by the projects. They don't seem unreasonably difficult or too easy, and I genuinely 
				feel like I'm learning skills I didn't know before with each one.
				</p>  
			  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My tip-of-the-week is to not do what I did the past week and actually 
				spend a non-insignificant amount of time doing design for the projects, without actually writing any code. I ran into a couple 
				frustrating bugs that could have been avoided entirely had I spend more time with a pencil and paper thinking about what I needed to 
				do, instead of jumping straight into the code.
