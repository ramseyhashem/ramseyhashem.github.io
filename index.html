<h1>CS371p Fall 2017: Ramsey Hashem</h1>

<h2>Week 1</h2>
<div style="width: 900px; max-width: 80%;">
<ol style="font-size: 30px;">
  <b><li>What are your expectations of the class?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My main expectation for this class is that
	I'll come away from it knowing C++. My main motivation for taking
	this class is that I want to take Computer Graphics next semester,
	and C++ is a prerequisite for that class. So this class is a way to not
	only satisfy part of my degree plan, but also force me to learn C++, 
	which will hopefully prepare me for Graphics.</p>
  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">This past week I've been getting back into the
	swing of things as the semester starts back up. It has involved a lot of 
	syllabus-reading and textbook-purchasing, but at least I'm pretty 
	well-acquainted with the campus and know my way around the 40 acres now that
	I'm in my third year here at UT.</p>
  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">The biggest obstacle in my way at this point is 
	my own mind. This year I'm more independent on campus than ever, so it's up
	to me to hold myself accountable so I can do well this semester. The way
	I'm tackling that is by always keeping my goals in mind. I want to get an
	internship this summer, so I'm very conscious of how my decisions can
	affect those prospects, and I hope that will keep me on track.</p> 
  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Next week will involve me doing my first major
	homework assignments of the year and will have me beginning a search for new
	student organizations to join and new people to meet.</p>  
  <b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My first impression of the class is pretty
	favorable! After taking CS429 and CS439, both of which had two-hour
	lectures, it has felt pretty refreshing to be taking a CS class that
	is only an hour as opposed to two. I also like Professor Downing's teaching
	style involving taking notes as class progresses. In the past, I've found
	it difficult to balance listening to lecture and taking notes, especially
	when the information is all on a powerpoint that I can just download after.
	So Dr. Downing's note-taking has been a helpful way for me to keep up with
	the most important concepts and questions to keep in mind.</p>  
  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My pick-of-the-week is actually something I'm
	using to do this blog! It's an HTML5 tutorial provided by w3schools: 
	<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">Check it out!</a>
	It has been a while since I did any sort of web design, so this tutorial
	has been a great refresher for me. And although it looks very basic
	at this point, I hope to spruce this blog up and add some more style and
	some Javascript as the semester goes on.</p>
