			  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">This past week I spent most of my time doing the Darwin project. Unfortunately, I came 
				across some nasty bugs that resulted in me essentially redoing the entire project, but I got it working regardless. I also went to my interview with Home 
				Depot, and receieved an internship offer for this summer! Additionally, I went to the Student Government meeting and told the student representatives about 
				what is going on regarding IT at the university.
				</p>
			  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">Right now, I'm focused on making it to Thanksgiving. These past couple week have been pretty 
				busy and stressful, and the next couple show no signs of being any different. I have to make sure I stay focused and keep a level head so I can get through 
				it in one piece.
				</p> 
			  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">Next week I have two tests: one in Algorithms and Complexity and one in Chemistry. 
				This is the second and last test for Algo before the final, so I'm hoping to do a little better than I did last time. I'm not too worried about Chem 
				since I've been doing well on the tests in that class, but I still need to study for it. I also have an interview for a position on campus on the 
				Election Supervisory Board, which I'm excited about.
				</p> 
				<b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">I feel like the Darwin project probably represents this class the best out of all 
				the projects we've done so far. It was also the hardest one we've done so far! I definitely faced some of the design concerns that come into place 
				when trying to implement object-oriented design. 
				</p>  
			  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My pick-of-the-week is a bit of a lighthearted YouTube video in which user The Coding Train 
				codes Flappy Bird in JavaScript in 20 minutes. He's got a very upbeat attitude and is fun to watch.
