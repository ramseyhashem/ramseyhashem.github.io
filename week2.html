<h2>Week 2</h2>
<div style="width: 900px; max-width: 80%;">
<ol style="font-size: 30px;">
  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">This past week I got done setting and connecting to all 
	the various websites and services needed for my classes. I also finished my first 
	project of the school year, a 3D character model for my Digital Art and Production 
	class, AET 326. On top of that, I went to the football game and watched the Longhorns
	get their first win of the season!</p>
  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">There seems to be a small, but critical roadblock in
	my way at this point. The first one is for this class and comes in the form of 
	getting everything set up for the Collatz project. There are a lot of steps involved
	and a lot of aspects to the workflow that I've never done before, so it's important 
	for me to get past that initial hurdle.</p> 
  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Next week will have me completing the Collatz project,
	getting prepared for my first test of the year (Chemistry), and starting up the work
	for the online Finance class I'm taking as part of my Business Foundations Certificate.</p>  
  <b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My experience of this class remains positive. I really
	enjoyed the class time that was spent going over the workflow for the project, 
	because it is a lot more complicated than I anticipated. I also enjoyed the 
	discussion of the project itself and the various optimizations we walked through
	that we should consider implementing. I feel a lot more confident regarding Collatz
	because of those class days.</p>  
  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My pick-of-the-week is a really interesting video
	I watched from the Black Hat Briefings that took place this past July, entitled
	"Breaking the x86 Instruction Set." It's a very interesting talk where the speaker
	discusses secret instructions and bugs found within processors and talks about how
	developers are meant to blindly trust that the processor is doing what the manufacturer
	says it does, which is evidently not always the case.
