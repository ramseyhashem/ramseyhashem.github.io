			  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">This past week I took both my Algorithms and Complexity test as well as my Chemistry test. 
				I also got started on the Life project for this class. Finally, I had a phone interview for a summer internship with Sony, which I think went pretty well.
				</p>
			  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">It is important that I take advantage of Thanksgiving break to try to get caught up and ahead 
				on the academic side of things. It will be really easy to blow stuff off when I'm back home, so I have to make sure that doesn't happen!
				</p> 
			  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">Next week I'm going to be spending a lot of time getting the Life project done and making more 
				progress in my online Accounting class. I also have another IT Committee meeting on Monday. On top of that, I'll also be enjoying the Thanksgiving break back home, 
				which I'm looking forward to.
				</p> 
				<b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My experience of the class is largely the same. The Life project seems to be similar to the 
				Darwin project in terms of some of the object-oriented design principles it requires, but I'm excited to add inheritance into the mix. I think after this project, 
				I'll have a pretty well-rounded experience from this class and have a good idea regarding what it takes to create well-designed programs in an object-oriented language.
				</p>  
			  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My pick-of-the-week is OpenGL, which is a C++ graphics library used for both 2D and 3D graphics. 
				I've started learning about OpenGL and how it is used to make games in C++.</a>
