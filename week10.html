			  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">This past week I finished up and presented my 3D environment project 
				for AET 326, which I think turned out pretty well. You can check it out below! Additionally, I registered for classes for next semester.
				I also spent a lot of time applying for several summer internships and preparing for an interview I have this week. Wish me luck!

			  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">This upcoming week is set to be very busy, so it's important that I don't 
				get behind on anything. I've begun to fall a bit behind on my online Finance class, so I need to catch up before it becomes unmanageable.
				</p> 
			  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">Next week I'm going to be finishing up the Darwin project mainly. I'm 
				also going to continue to apply to internships, and also plan on going to the Student Government meeting to fulfill my IT Committee 
				appointment responsibilities and relay to the student body some of the news that has been happening regarding IT at UT.
				</p> 
				<b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My experience of this class is pretty consistent. I feel like now with the 
				Darwin project I'm able to implement some of the object-oriented design aspects we've been learning about, which is pretty exciting.
				</p>  
			  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My tip-of-the-week is a quote about waking up in the morning from the book 
				"Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius: "In the morning, when you rise unwillingly, let this thought be present: I am rising to the work of the 
				human being. Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world? [...] 
				Do you not see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees working together to put in order their separate parts 
				of the universe? And are you unwilling to do the work of a himan being, and do you not make haste to do that which is according to your nature?"
				So when you don't feel like getting out of bed in the morning, just remember that you have the work of a human to do and a universe to contribute
				to.
