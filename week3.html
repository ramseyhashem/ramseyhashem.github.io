<h2>Week 3</h2>
<div style="width: 900px; max-width: 80%;">
<ol style="font-size: 30px;">
  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My major accomplishment of this past week was finishing
	the Collatz project! It ended up taking longer than I anticipated, but I'm happy 
	with how it turned out. Unfortunately, I missed out on the career fair as a result 
	of finishing up Collatz, but I'm getting back into "internship application" mode 
	as companies start listing more available positions. I also attended the first IT 
	Committee meeting of the year, and was pleasantly surprised to see Dr. Downing there 
	as well! I'm the Student Government appointment to that committee, and it seems like it 
	will be a very interesting body to be a part of.</p>
  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Something that has become a bit of an issue these first
	few weeks of the semester is the difference in my schedule between Monday/Wednesday
	and Tuesday/Thursday. On MW I have class from 1-4:30pm, whereas I go from 9:30-12:30
	on TTh. As a result, I've developed a bit of a warped sleep schedule lately where I'm
	sleeping in about every other day, and I feel like I'm losing some productivity as a 
	result. So I'm going to attempt to correct that by forcing myself to wake up at the 
	same time every day, and hopeful that will boost my productivity.</p> 
  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Next week I'll be taking my first test of the semester in 
	chemistry, which I feel pretty prepared for. I'm also going to rigging the 3D character
	model I made last week for my Digital Production Art class, which should be interesting. 
	<b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Thankfully, I still have a positive experience of the class 
	after our first programming assignment of the semester. As I said earlier, it took me 
	longer than I expected, which is due to all the Travis CI and GitHub setup that was 
	required. I eventually got a handle on that though, and the actual solving of the Collatz 
	problem felt pretty straightforward. I'm sure the projects will get more difficult, but 
	at this point I'm feeling confident in my programming abilities.</p>  
  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My pick-of-the-week is a program called WinSCP that I've used
	as an SSH tool for the past couple years. Going to the CS lab isn't always convenient, so
	having a good way of SSHing into those machines has been a lifesaver. One thing I like 
	it is that it has a nice interface which allows for seemlessly moving files between your 
	machine and the one you've SSHed into.</p>
