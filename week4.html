<h2>Week 4</h2>

<ol style="font-size: 30px;">
  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">This past week I took my first test of the semester in 
	Chemistry and managed to get an A! I also rigged the character model I made in my 
	Digital Art Production class, meaning that it's now ready to animate, which I'm 
	excited about doing. I also tackled a good chunk of my online Finance class, which 
	is entirely self-paced, and got started on the Voting project for this class.</p>
  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Right now I think I've developed a pretty good routine 
	with the way I'm approaching my classes, so it's important that I don't get complacent 
	and begin slacking. I had a bit of a wake up call this past week when I realized that I
	forgot to turn a homework assignment, so I need to make sure that I'm being more vigilant 
	when it comes to my organization.</p> 
  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Next week I'll be spending a lot of my time finishing up 
	the Voting project for this class, and also plan on going to the Student Government 
	meeting to do my duties as the IT Committee appointment and keep the Assembly informed 
	on what is going on regarding IT at the university.</p> 
	<b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">While the material we've been going over has been getting 
	slightly more complicated, I feel like things are still explained very well, and I 
	haven't had much trouble understanding each day's topic.</p>  
  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My tip-of-the-week is to not just use HackerRank for the 
	class projects and to do some of the coding challenges that they have available there. 
	I've found it to be a handy tool for staying sharp with languages like Java that I don't 
	use as much nowadays.</p>
