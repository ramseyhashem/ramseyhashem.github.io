			  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">This past week was pretty run-of-the-mill as far as school goes. 
				I did some chemistry homework, got to work on my next 3D modeling assignment, and started on Project 3 for this class. In addition 
				to all that, I celebrated my 21st birthday on Tuesday!
				</p>
			  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My biggest obstacle right now is to not let the middle of the 
				semester get to me. This time in the semester can often times get boring and more stressful as more midterms pop up while still 
				being faced with a month and a half left. It's important to keep the rhythm I've developed going!
				</p> 
			  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">Next week I'm going to be spending a good chunk of time finishing 
				up Project 3, doing my 3D modeling assignment, and studying for my next Chemistry test. 
				</p> 
				<b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My experience of the class remains unchanged from last week. I now 
				feel like I have a solid grasp of the flow of the class, from the lectures, to the projects, to the exams. I feel like I am 
				underperforming on the in-class quizzes, however, so I hope to increase my average on the remainder of those. 
				</p>  
			  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
				<p style="margin-top: 6px; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal">My pick-of-the-week is Pixar in a Box! PIAB is an awesome online 
				set of lessons in which Pixar has teamed up with Khan Academy to take you through their production pipeline for their films and 
				explain the underlying math and science that they then program into their tools. As someone with an interest in working in Computer 
				Graphics, I've found Pixar in a Box to be incredibly interesting and enjoyable.
