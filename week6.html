<h2>Week 6</h2>

<ol style="font-size: 30px;">
  <b><li>What did you do this past week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">This past week wasn't too bad in terms of my workload. I attended 
	all my classes, got some chores done, and continued to work on internship applications. I also 
	spent quite a bit of time studying for my first Algorithms test, which ended up being rather 
	difficult, although the grades have yet to come back.
	</p>
  <b><li>What's in your way?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Time is in my way. This upcoming week it set to be my most hectic 
	of the semester, and it's always a bit of a challenge making sure I've covered all my 
	school obligations as well as other aspects of my life.</p> 
  <b><li>What will you do next week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Next week is going to be pretty packed. I have two tests, one 
	in chemistry and one in this class, so I'll be spending a lot of time studying for those. 
	I also have a modeling assignment in my AET326 class, which will likely be pretty 
	time-consuming. And on top of that, I'll be going home this weekend for the Texas-OU football
	game!</p> 
	<b><li>What's your experience of the class?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My opinions of the class have remained unchanged, though with the 
	first test looming it will be interesting to find out what that whole experience is like for 
	this class and to quantify just how much I've learned so far. I'm not too worried about the test 
	but I know I'm going to have to do quite a bit of studying for it.</p>  
  <b><li>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</li></b>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">My tip-of-the-week is to mix up how you study. I've found that studying 
	alone in my quiet apartment isn't nearly as effective for me than a) studying with other people, and 
	b) adding variety to where I study.
